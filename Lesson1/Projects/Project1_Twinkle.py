#The following code will print a song on the screen in a specific way (with indentation in the printed lines)

print('''Twinkle, twinkle, litte star
        How I wonder what you are!
                Up above the world so high,
                Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
        How I wonder what you are.''')
